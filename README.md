# React Start App

This starter app is inspired by the `create-react-app` node module, and modeled after Tyler McGinnis' [ReactJsProgram](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/React-Fundamentals).

It is intended as a lightweight scaffold to help you get your first React app up and running, with the tooling that is considered current best practices.

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository, then run `npm install`. Once that completes, run `npm run start` to launch your development server.

In your web browser, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see the "Welcome to React!" welcome message.
